## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq API key for AI services | Required |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Environment (development/production) | development |
| `PORT` | Server port | 8000 |
| `MAX_QUESTIONS` | Maximum questions per quiz | 8 |
| `MIN_QUESTIONS` | Minimum questions before recommendation | 6 |

### Course Data

The system uses `data/courses.json` for course information. You can:
- Edit the file directly to add/modify courses
- The file is created automatically with sample data if it doesn't exist
- Each course should have: `name`, `link`, `tags`, `description`, `provider`, `duration`, `level`

## ü§ñ AI Prompting Strategy

### Question Generation
The system uses sophisticated prompts to generate adaptive questions:
- Analyzes conversation history to avoid repetition
- Focuses on different aspects: interests, skills, preferences, goals
- Uses various question types: multiple choice, rating scale, yes/no, open-ended
- Adapts complexity based on previous answers

### Course Recommendation
The recommendation engine:
- Analyzes complete conversation history
- Matches user profile against available courses
- Provides confidence scores and detailed reasoning
- Considers interests, skills, learning preferences, and career goals

## üîÑ Frontend Integration

### API Call Examples

#### Getting the First Question
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/v1/next-question', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    conversation_history: [],
    user_id: 'user_123' // optional
  })
});
const data = await response.json();
```

#### Submitting an Answer and Getting Next Question
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/v1/next-question', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    conversation_history: [
      {
        question: "What subjects did you enjoy most in school?",
        answer: "Computer science and mathematics",
        question_type: "open_ended",
        options: null
      }
    ],
    user_id: 'user_123'
  })
});
```

#### Getting Final Recommendation
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/v1/recommend', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    conversation_history: [/* array of 6-8 Q&A pairs */],
    user_id: 'user_123'
  })
});
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the test script to verify all endpoints:
```bash
python test_api.py
```

## üìù Logging

The application includes comprehensive logging:
- Request/response logging
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Debug information in development mode

## üîí Security

- CORS properly configured
- Input validation using Pydantic
- Environment variable protection
- Session management with expiration
- Error handling without sensitive data exposure

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Groq API Key Issues**:
   - Ensure the API key is correctly set in environment variables
   - Check API key permissions and quotas

2. **Port Already in Use**:
   ```bash
   # Change port in .env file
   PORT=8001
   ```

3. **Module Import Errors**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure virtual environment is activated
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Session Storage Issues**:
   - Check that `data/sessions` directory exists and is writable
   - Clear old session files if needed

### Development Tips

- Use the `/health` endpoint to verify the API is running
- Check logs for detailed error information
- Use the test script to validate functionality
- Monitor the `data/sessions` directory for session files

## üìà Scaling Considerations

- Session data is currently file-based; consider Redis for production scaling
- Course data is loaded in memory; consider database for large datasets
- Add rate limiting for production use
- Implement caching for frequently requested data
- Consider load balancing for high traffic
